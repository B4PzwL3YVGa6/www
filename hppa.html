<h2>OpenBSD/hppa</h2>

<h3><hr>
<strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

There is currently no hppa port.  However there is sufficient code
available from the Utah Mach project to make this relatively easy.
Utah also has a BSD that runs on the hppa, but that code is not
available because it is based on NET/2.
