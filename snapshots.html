<h2>OpenBSD Snapshots</h2>

<h3><hr>
<strong>How OpenBSD Snapshots are built:</strong></h3>

Binary snapshots are supposed to be easy to use and install.  To ease
their use, they are always statically linked.  Developers have built
these distributions by doing<p>

<pre>
	setenv LDSTATIC -static
	cd /usr/src
	make obj
	make build
	setenv DESTDIR /dir
	make snapshot
</pre>

If you find a snapshot that is dynamically linked, please inform
deraadt@openbsd.org.<p>

In each snapshot, all tar.gz files are rooted at /.  If you are a
trusting kind of person you can use the following script.  However it
is suggested that you not blindly install snapshots in this fashion.<p>

<pre>
	foreach i ( `pwd`/*.tar.gz )
	    ( cd /; tar --unlink zxvpf $i )
	end
</pre>

The tar program you use must be GNU tar or some other newer
posix-compliant version.  The tar files contain directory information
in a new format, in particular dev.tar.gz contains all sorts of files
that an older version of tar would break on.  Also, one should be able
to use just about any version of pax instead.<p>

<h3><hr>
<strong>But I want dynamic binaries!:</strong></h3>

Real Releases, when they are made, will not be statically linked.<p>

If you desire dynamic binaries on your machine, do the following:<p>

<pre>
	cd /usr/src
	make obj
	make build
</pre>

This will rebuild your machine's binaries in the normal way.  of
course, before doing this later step of rebuilding all the binaries on
your machine, realize that source code quality can vary from day to
day -- on some days the make build might fail and you might run into
nasty problems.<p>
