<h1>OpenBSD project goals</h1>

Each person working on OpenBSD has their own aims and priorities,
but the goals of project as a whole are to:

<ul>
<li>    Provide the best development platform possible - with
        full source access for openbsd developers and users
<li>	Work towards a machine independent source tree.
<li>    Support as many different systems and hardware as feasible.
<li>    Be as politics free as possible - solutions should be
        decided on the basis of technical merit.
<li>    Provide a good cross compile/development platform.
<li>    Integrate good code from any source with acceptable
        copyright (Berkeley style preferred, GPL acceptable, NDA not).
<li>    Import external packages with minimal modifications -
        making upgrading much easier. Also to submit back to the
        developers any changes made.
</ul>
