<h2>OpenBSD/mvme88k</h2>

<h3><hr>
<strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>
The code in the tree is intended for the Motorola 88K series of VME cards.
Theo is researching the history.  The initial code is from the CMU MACH
Luna88k development project, but it isn't clear who all the later people
were.  The mvme88k models have the basically the same IO devices and
layout as the MVME167, which is supported by the mvme68k port.

<p>
The mvme88k port does not currently work.  It is looking for people who
want to work on it.

<p>
Noone is currently working on this port to finish it, but Theo de Raadt
would love to hear from anyone who is interested in working together on
it.
