Monochrome (<a href="http://www.mono.org">mono.org</a>)
</h3>
A cluster of OpenBSD/sparc & OpenBSD/i386 machines at
<a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/">City University</a>, London
(UK), running probably the largest internet BBS in the UK. Best described as
'different', with a distinctive menu based interface that you will either
love or hate, Monochrome is a unique microcosm that defies description.
