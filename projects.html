<h1>OpenBSD project goals</h1>

Each person working on OpenBSD has their own aims and priorities, but the
goals of project as a whole are to:

<ul>
<li>    Provide the best development platform possible - with
        full source access for openbsd developers and users
<li>	Work towards a machine independent source tree.
<li>    Support as many different systems and hardware as feasible.
<li>    Be as politics free as possible - solutions should be
        decided on the basis of technical merit.
<li>    Provide a good cross compile/development platform.
<li>    Integrate good code from any source with acceptable
        copyright (Berkeley style preferred, GPL acceptable, NDA not).
<li>    Import external packages with minimal modifications -
        making upgrading much easier. Also to submit back to the
        developers any changes made.
</ul>

<h3>Projects looking for a home (Help wanted)</h3>

There are various ways in which people who have time to spare can help
the OpenBSD project. Some require technical knowledge, while others do not:

<ul>
<li> <b>Tracking NetBSD commits</b><br>
        OpenBSD was originally derived from NetBSD, and still tracks the
        changes & improvements made to NetBSD. If you have the time to
        assist in such work please get in touch with Niklas Hallqvist
        <a href=mailto:niklas@openbsd.org>&lt;niklas@openbsd.org&gt;</a>
<li> <b>Sparc esp driver</b><br>
        The sparc esp scsi driver has two known problems - on some systems
        with a floppy drive the scsi probe will hang unless there is a disk
        in the drive, and more seriously multiple scsi targets do not
        currently work. The current driver was written by Theo de Raadt
        <a href=mailto:deraadt@theos.com>&lt;deraadt@theos.com&gt;</a>, but
        he is currently on vacation - so contact
        <a href=mailto:tech@openbsd.org>&lt;tech@openbsd.org&gt;</a>, but
</ul>
