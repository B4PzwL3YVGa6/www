<h3>Ongoing Projects</h3>

There are many people working on specific projects for OpenBSD, some of which
we cannot mention here yet. Here are some that we can...

<ul>
<li> <b>Cross compilation</b><br>
	Building a complete system on a different architecture.
<li> <b>PCMCIA support</b><br>
	Initially for the i386 port (in the tree already).
<li> <b>More ports</b><br>
	Many more ports... :)
</ul>
<h3>Projects looking for a home (Help wanted)</h3>

There are various ways in which people who have time to spare can help
the OpenBSD project. Some require technical knowledge, while others do not:

<ul>
<li> <b>Tracking NetBSD commits</b><br>
        OpenBSD was originally derived from NetBSD, and still tracks the
        changes & improvements made to NetBSD. If you have the time to
        assist in such work please get in touch with Niklas Hallqvist
        <a href=mailto:niklas@openbsd.org>&lt;niklas@openbsd.org&gt;</a>
<li> <b>Sparc esp driver</b><br>
        The sparc esp scsi driver has two known problems - on some systems
        with a floppy drive the scsi probe will hang unless there is a disk
        in the drive, and more seriously multiple scsi targets do not
        currently work. The current driver was written by Theo de Raadt
        <a href=mailto:deraadt@theos.com>&lt;deraadt@theos.com&gt;</a>,
	(now back from vacation :).
<li> <b>Documentation</b><br>
	Enough said - everyone is always looking for people to help on
	documentation!
</ul>
